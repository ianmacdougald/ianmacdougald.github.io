## Description

Patterned Landscapes is a piece for percussion and real-time electronics, depicting remote sonic spaces using a diverse array of instruments and digital techniques. It was written for [Russell Greenberg](http://www.russellgreenberg.net/) and premiered at Brown University in the fall of 2016. Throughout the piece, musical momentum is driven by the mimetic relationship between the performer and a software system. Using SuperCollider's [pattern library](https://doc.sccode.org/Tutorials/A-Practical-Guide/PG_01_Introduction.html), the software manipulates samples captured during a rehearsal of the instruments used in the performance, recomposing them into the motives that define each respective section while both software and instrumentalist alike negotiate a shifting interactional dynamic.

In the first section, the performer is tasked with accompanying the eletronics, ornamenting samples of a vibraphone, wood blocks, and crotales with gestures performed on those same instruments in order to establish the acousmastic sources of the SuperCollider system within the space of the performance. Then a reversal occurs, as the performer takes over the melodic foreground, recreating the piece's initial patterns, while the electronics explore alternative timbres without a distinct melodic focus. Subsequently, both software and instrumentalist continue to trade between tending to the melody and mapping the boundaries of the sound world, doing so in a cooperative manner that underscores the harmonious qualities of the music itself.

In the second section, this dynamic breaks down as the performer attempts to take control of the system. Increasingly less conventional techniques are used to trigger spastic reactions from the software, which, in response to both the tumultuousness of the moment and its unequal positioning with respect to the player, abandons the samples that once connected them in favor of synthesized bursts of noise. This continues until the system, in an apparent offering of musical peace, begins introducing timbres from bowed cymbals. The player eventually follows suit, and the two start cooperating once more, although with some hestitancy. Trust is only restored when the system restates the initial patterns. Then recapitulation ensues, and the piece ends in a musical atmosphere of human-software comity.
