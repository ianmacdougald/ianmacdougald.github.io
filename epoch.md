## Description

Epoch for Digital Petri Dish is a fixed-media piece made using [GenOrg](https://github.com/ianmacdougald/GenOrg), an experimental SuperCollider quark I developed for my master's thesis. The core classes in the quark provide functionality for dynamically generating [SynthDef](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/SynthDef.html) objects, rendering sound files in [non-realtime](https://doc.sccode.org/Guides/Non-Realtime-Synthesis.html), and providing spatialization in mono, stereo, quad, first order ambisonic, as well as higher ambisonic formats. From there, whole populations of processes are defined and coordinated such that they exhibit characteristics of organisms that hunt and die and mate and starve. Currently, there are two divergent branches of this project. The first, located on its **main** branch is the work I submitted for my Master's thesis, whereas the second version, located on the **dev** branch, represents a version I am refactoring to be compliant with the framework of another project of mine called [CodexIan](https://github.com/ianmacdougald/CodexIan), which enable classes to be developed with modular, scriptable components, thus making them endlessly configureable. This second version is the one I used to generate the material for the current piece.
