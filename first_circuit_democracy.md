## Description

First Circuit Democracy is a piece made from a digitally-extended analogue feedback network consisting of an 8-channel Mackie mixer and a simple process running in SuperCollider. In this arrangement, a stereo signal from the computer is patched to the first two channels of the mixer, while the mixer's control room outputs are connected to its third and fourth channels and its main outputs are routed back into the system's digital component. Within SuperCollider, the signal from the mixer is sent through a short delay line whose delay time and dry/wet balance are modulated by slow-moving random signals, thus adding to the serendipitous chaos transpiring within the hardware. 

The piece is made up of two sections, separated by a few moments of pallette-cleansing silence, representing a single minimally-edited live recording. In each section, feedback is ignited by overdriving the mixer's filters, and musical form is sculpted by manipulating the gain and panning parameters of each respective channel strip, although the impact of these parameters is difficult to predit. At times, panning a signal across outputs might cause the music to erupt into a state of relentless clicking or even settle into a sonorous drone. At others, turning a pan pot might affect the overall amplitude of the signal while the faders curiously influence its timbre. In this way, this patch liberates the device's potential beyond its designers' intentions, and, as such, the music represents a potent expression of the circuit's newfound self-determination.
