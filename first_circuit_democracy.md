## Description

First Circuit Democracy is a piece made from a digitally-extended analogue feedback network consisting of an 8-channel Mackie mixer and a simple process running in SuperCollider. The feedback network is established by patching a stereo output from SuperCollider to the first two channels of the mixer, while the mixer's control room outputs are connected to its third and fourth inputs; its main outputs are then routed back into the system's digital component. Within SuperCollider, the signal from the mixer is sent through a short delay line whose delay time and dry/wet balance are modulated by slow-moving random signals, thus adding to the serendipitous chaos transpiring within the hardware. 

The piece is made up of two sections separated by a few moments of pallette-cleansing silence, cumulatively representing a single minimally-edited live take. In each section, feedback is ignited by overdriving the mixer's filters, and musical form is sculpted by manipulating the gain and panning parameters of each respective channel strip. Interaction with the hardware produces non-linear and often unpredictable effects on the music itself. For instance, throughout the recording process, panning a signal across outputs caused an eruption of relentless clicking at one time and instigated the onset of a sonorous drone at another. In this way, the patch liberates the device's sonic potential beyond its designers' intentions, and, as such, the music that emerges from it expresses the circuit's sense of self-determination.
