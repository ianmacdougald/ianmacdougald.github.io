## Description

Patterned Landscapes is a piece for percussion and real-time electronics, depicting remote sonic spaces using a diverse array of instruments and digital techniques. It was written for [Russell Greenberg](http://www.russellgreenberg.net/) and premiered at Brown University in the fall of 2016. The name of the piece is derived both from its focus on soundscape composition as well as its deployment of SuperCollider's [pattern library](https://doc.sccode.org/Tutorials/A-Practical-Guide/PG_01_Introduction.html). Over the course of its performance, musical momentum is driven by the mimetic relationship between the performer and a software system. The software manipulates samples captured during a rehearsal of the instruments used in the performance, recomposing them into the motives that define each respective section, as the instrumentalist navigates a shifting interactional dynamic. 

In the first section, responsibilities for melody and harmony are divided evenly between the performer and the software. Initially, the melody is established by the electronics from samples of woodblocks, crotales, and vibraphone as the performer ornaments the music with sounds produced on those same instruments. Then a reversal occurs, and the performer recreates the melody, while the electronics explores alternative timbres, mapping the ever-expanding borders of the sound world. In this way, the performer and software cooperatively share the musical space, underscoring the harmonious qualities of the music itself.

In the second section, this dynamic breaks down as the performer attempts to take control of the system. Increasingly less conventional techniques are used to trigger spastic reactions from the software, which, in response to both the tumultuousness of the moment and its unequal positioning with respect to the player, abandons the samples that once connected them in favor of synthesized bursts of noise. This continues until the system, in an apparent offering of musical peace, begins introducing timbres from bowed cymbals. The player eventually follows suit, and the two start cooperating once more, although with some hestitancy. Trust is only restored when the system restates the initial patterns. Then recapitulation ensues, and the piece ends in a musical atmosphere of human-software comity.
