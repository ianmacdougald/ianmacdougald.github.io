## Description

Patterned Landscapes is a piece for percussion and real-time electronics, depicting remote sonic spaces using a diverse array of instruments and digital techniques. It was written for [Russell Greenberg](http://www.russellgreenberg.net/) and premiered at Brown University in the fall of 2016. The name of the piece is derived both from its focus on soundscape composition as well as its deployment of SuperCollider's [pattern library](https://doc.sccode.org/Tutorials/A-Practical-Guide/PG_01_Introduction.html). 

Over the course of its performance, musical momentum is driven by the mimetic relationship between the performer and a software system. The software manipulates samples captured during a rehearsal of the instruments used in the performance, recomposing them into the motives that define each respective section, as the instrumentalist navigates a shifting interactional dynamic.
