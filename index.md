# Greetings!

My portfolio features four pieces composed within the last four years that show case various methodologies for making electronic and electro-acoustic music. Each page contains a link either to Vimeo or to Soundcloud where recordings of the associated piece are hosted as well as technical descriptions outlining my compositional process. 

* [Patterned Landscapes](patterned_landscapes), *percussion and real-time electronics*
* The First Circuit Democracy, *analogue-digital feedback network*
* Epoch for Digital Petri Dish, *fixed media*
* Temporality streams, *granular synthesizer and violin controller*
