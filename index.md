# Greetings!

My portfolio features four pieces composed within the last four years that show case various methodologies for making electronic and electro-acoustic music. Each page contains a link either to Vimeo or to Soundcloud where recordings of the associated piece are hosted as well as technical descriptions outlining my compositional process.
