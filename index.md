# Greetings!

My name is Ian, and I love to hear and make noise. On this page, you can find four of my piece, which, together, consist of a portfolio outlining some of my recent musical interests and technical abilities.

Within each page, there is a link to the recording of the piece, a link to its source-code, and a description of how it was made.

* [Patterned Landscapes](patterned_landscapes.md), *percussion and real-time electronics*
* [First Circuit Democracy](first_circuit_democracy.md), *analogue-digital feedback network*
* [Epoch for Digital Petri Dish](epoch.md), *fixed media*
* [Temporality Streams](temporality_streams.md), *granular synthesizer with violin controller*
