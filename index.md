# Greetings!

My portfolio features four pieces composed within the last four years that show case various methodologies for making electronic and electro-acoustic music. Each page contains a link either to Vimeo or to Soundcloud where recordings of the associated piece are hosted as well as technical descriptions outlining my compositional process. 

### [Patternd Landscapes](patterned_landscapes.md), percussion and real-time electronics

### The First Circuit Democracy, analogue-digital feedback network

### Epoch For Digital Petri Dish, fixed-media 

### Temporality Streams, digital synthesizer with violin controller
