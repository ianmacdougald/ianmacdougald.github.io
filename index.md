# Greetings!

The following four pieces make up my portfolio of some recent work by any and all who might wish to review it. Each piece was designed to showcase both my technical skills and musical interests in electro-acoustic improvisation and composition. On each page, there is a link to the recording of a piece, a link to its source-code, and also a description of how it was made.

* [First Circuit Democracy](first_circuit_democracy.md), *analogue-digital feedback network*
* [Patterned Landscapes](patterned_landscapes.md), *percussion and real-time electronics*
* [Epoch for Digital Petri Dish](epoch.md), *fixed media*
* [Temporality Streams](temporality_streams.md), *granular synthesizer with violin controller*

Thank you for your consideration!

Ian
