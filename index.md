# Greetings!

The following four pieces make up my portfolio for review by doctoral admissions committees. Each piece was designed to showcase both my technical skills and musical interests in electro-acoustic improvisation and composition. On each page, there is a link to the recording of a piece, a link to its source-code, and also a description of how it was made.

* [Patterned Landscapes](patterned_landscapes.md), *percussion and real-time electronics*
* [First Circuit Democracy](first_circuit_democracy.md), *analogue-digital feedback network*
* Epoch for Digital Petri Dish, *fixed media*
* Temporality streams, *granular synthesizer with violin controller*

Thank you for your consideration!

Ian
