## Description

Temporality Streams for digital granular synthesizer with electronic violin controller is an exploration of sonic quanta shifting across space time. Pops, clicks, scratches, and occasional notes flutter super-positionally throughout the musical field as they are subjected to improvisational experiments designed to break them down and build them up, eliciting, in turn, their unique characteristics. The piece was written at the end of 2019 and was to be premiered during the 2020 New York City Electroacoustic Music Festival, although, for reasons relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, a performance did not take place. 


The piece is composed in four sections designed to explore different concepts of temporal musical organization. The first section consists of pops and clicks produced on the violin, which are recorded into a buffer; the contents of the buffer are manipulated via the granular synthesizer algorithms whose parameters are mapped to controls derived from the pitch, amplitude, and timbral features extracted from the violin. In this way, the sectionâ€™s music features the violin in a constantly present state of interpreting its immediate past. 

The second section builds on the material of the first by extending the granulation of the sounds into the domains of the meta and the meta-meta. The cumulative result is a cascading butterfly effect of granular synthesis extending in time far beyond the initial input of the violin, and, as such, the music moves in its perspective from an exploration of the relationship between the past and the present to one exploring the relationship between the present and the future. 

The third and fourth sections complement the premises of the first and second. In the third section, the real-time synthesis procedures are replaced by a metaphorically-apt time-stretching algorithm on an audio file while the fourth section observes a return of the original material, but subjected to long delays and desolate reverberations. The piece is designed for an improvisational live performance, and so the recording of it can be considered, in a sense, both a realization of this performance as well as a work-in-progress instance representing a still developing understanding of the systems at play.
