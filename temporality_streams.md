## Description

Temporality Streams for digital granular synthesizer with electronic violin controller is an exploration of sonic quanta shifting across space time. Pops, clicks, scratches, and occasional notes flutter super-positionally throughout the musical field as they are subjected to improvisational experiments designed to break them down and build them up, eliciting, in turn, their unique characteristics. The piece was written at the end of 2019 and was to be premiered during the 2020 New York City Electroacoustic Music Festival, although, for reasons relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, a performance did not take place.
