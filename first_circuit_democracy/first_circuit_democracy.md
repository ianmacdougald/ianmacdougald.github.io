## Description

First Circuit Democracy is a piece for a digitally-extended analogue feedback network consisting of an 8-channel Mackie mixer and a simple process running in SuperCollider. The network is patched such that the digital system outputs a stereo signal into channels 1 and 2 of the mixer, that the mixer's control room output is routed into channels 2 and 3, and that the main outputs are patched back into SuperCollider. Within SuperCollider, the signal from the mixer is sent through a short delay line whose delay time and dry/wet balance are modulated by slow-moving random signals, thus adding to the serendipitous chaos transpiring within the hardware. 

The piece is made up of two sections, separated by a few moments of pallette-cleansing silence, representing a single minimally-edited live recording. In each section, feedback is ignited by overdriving the mixer's filters, and musical form is sculpted by manipulating the gain and panning parameters of each respective channel strip. Yet throughout my time experimenting with this system, I learned that the impact of turning a pan pot or moving a fader was entirely unpredictable. Sometimes, panning a signal across outputs would cause a rich droning texture to devolve into relentless clicks. At other times, it seemed to impact the signal's amplitude while the faders curiously altered timbre instead. In this way, the patch morphed the behavior of the device beyond its designers' intentions, rendering it into something wholly new. As a result, although I had some influence over its direction, the music represents the circuit's potent expression of aesthetic self-determination.
